# Javascript Calculator

[![View Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Calculator-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://syuyrw.github.io/Calculator/)

To help me develop my Javascript skills, I created this calculator. I wanted to make this specifically because it would help me get better at combining Javascript and HTML to make a program with an interactive UI.

## Description

This is a interactive web app calculator. It's very simple to use. It is used the same way you would use a handheld calculator. You can click the buttons to input a math equation, then the calculator screen will show the completed equation.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

-   I used math.js for the math functions

### Installing

-   To download the program, simply run this prompt on your command line:
    git clone https://github.com/syuyrw/Calculator

## Help

One thing to note is that you will need to press the "C" button after running a calculation to clear the screen before typing another equation.
